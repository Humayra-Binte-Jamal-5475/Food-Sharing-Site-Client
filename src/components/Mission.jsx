        At <span className="font-semibold">FoodLoop</span>, our mission is simple — to connect people
        who have extra food with those who need it, reducing waste and helping
        fight hunger in our communities.

        Every year, millions of tons of perfectly good food are thrown away
        while many people struggle to find their next meal. We believe that
        together, we can change that — one shared plate at a time.

        Whether you’re a donor, a volunteer, or someone in need, you are part of
        a movement that cares for people and the planet. Thank you for helping
        us make a difference.
